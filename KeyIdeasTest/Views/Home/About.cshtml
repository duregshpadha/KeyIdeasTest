                    <strong>Clinical Trial Agreement Standard Templates</strong><br>
                    Hundreds of clinical research contract professionals have contributed to MAGI’s standard CTA templates. MAGI’s clinical trial agreement handbook is the definitive guide to CTAs. MAGI members use the standard templates, handbook, model confidential disclosure agreement, budget template, and other documents as the basis for their own templates, in negotiations, and for training.
